 * This SDK provides a modern, high-level C++ abstraction layer over the native   *
 * SA-MP Plugin SDK. It is designed to simplify plugin development by offering    *
 * type-safe, object-oriented, and robust interfaces for interacting with the     *
 * SA-MP server and the Pawn scripting environment.                               *
 *                                                                                *
 * --- Core Architecture & Features ---                                           *
 *                                                                                *
 *  - Type-Safe C++ Interface:                                                    *
 *      > Write SA-MP natives and public callbacks as standard C++ functions.     *
 *      > Use C++ types like `int`, `float`, and `std::string` directly.          *
 *                                                                                *
 *  - Automatic Marshalling:                                                      *
 *      > The SDK automatically handles the complex conversion of data types      *
 *        (marshalling) between the C++ environment and the Pawn virtual          *
 *        machine.                                                                *
 *      > Transparently manages memory for strings and reference parameters.      *
 *                                                                                *
 *  - Powerful Hooking Engine:                                                    *
 *      > Seamlessly intercepts both Pawn public callbacks (with `Plugin_Public`) *
 *        and natives (with `Plugin_Native_Hook`).                                *
 *      > Allows multiple plugins built with the SDK to coexist and chain         *
 *        callbacks/hooks correctly without interfering with each other.          *
 *      > Supports "Ghost Callbacks" for hooking publics not present in the       *
 *        script.                                                                 *
 *                                                                                *
 *  - Simplified Pawn Interaction:                                                *
 *      > Call any Pawn native or public function from C++ with `Pawn(...)`.      *
 *      > The SDK automatically finds the target function (native or public).     *
 *      > Built-in utilities like `Pawn_Format` for easy string formatting.       *
 *                                                                                *
 *  - Dynamic Module System:                                                      *
 *      > Load and unload other plugins/modules dynamically from a host plugin    *
 *        using `Plugin_Module` and `Plugin_Unload_Module`.                       *
 *      > Enables building scalable and maintainable plugin architectures.        *
 *                                                                                *
 *  - Modern C++ Compatibility:                                                   *
 *      > Requires C++14 and automatically utilizes features up to C++20.         *
 *      > Encourages modern C++ practices for safer and more expressive code.     *
 *                                                                                *
